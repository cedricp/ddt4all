DDT4All is tool to create your own ECU parameters screens and connect to a CAN network with a cheap ELM327 interface.


### New Android porting: 
  - [Wiki Android port](https://github.com/cedricp/ddt4all/wiki/Android-port)
  - [Base Source Code of apk in gitlab](https://gitlab.com/DrQuark/android_can)

### Notes:
This application is work in progress, so be very careful when using expert mode.
Using the application in non expert mode should not be harmful for your vehicle (leave the expert mode button released).

**Important :**

**Do not use this software if you don't have a strong knowledge of how a CAN network (or ECU) works, you can really do bad things with it, especially if you're working on a vehicle**

**The author declines all responsibility about a bad use of this tool. You are the only responsible**

**This tool is mainly aimed for CAN ISO_TP network study**

## `Cloning Source Code`
### `Dependencies :`
![python_3.12.x](dtt4all_data/icons/Python-3-12-new.png)
* [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/) 
* [PyQt 5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/)
* [pyusb](https://pypi.org/project/pyusb/)
* [pyserial](https://pypi.org/project/pyserial/)
* [crcmod](https://pypi.org/project/crcmod/)
* [Python virtual environment](https://gist.github.com/dreamorosi/e2947827e5de92b69df68c88475eba38)

### Supported diagnostic adapters (so far)

* **ELM327** USB/BlueTooth/WiFi (Original one with _PIC18F25K80_, Chinese clone not working)
* **ObdLink** SX
* **ELS27**

Next, you need to get the source code.  This source code repository uses git submodules. So when you clone the source code, you will need to clone recursively:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/cedricp/ddt4all.git
```

Or if you already cloned without the recursive option, you can update the submodules by running:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/cedricp/ddt4all.git
cd ddt4all
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
