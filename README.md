# DDT4All

DDT4All is a tool to create your own ECU parameters screens and connect to a CAN network with a cheap ELM327 interface.

This application is work in progress, so be very careful when using expert mode.
Using the application in non expert mode should not be harmful for your vehicle (leave the expert mode button released).

**Important:**

**Do not use this software if you don't have a strong knowledge of how a CAN network (or ECU) works, you can really do bad things with it, especially if you're working on a vehicle**

**The author declines all responsibility about a bad use of this tool. You are the only responsible**

**This tool should be used primarily for CAN ISO_TP network study**
